# Join Template plugin
Alias to "join" plugin with predefined `start` and `continue` parameters.

> âš  Parsing the whole event flow could be very CPU intensive because the plugin uses regular expressions.
> Consider `match_fields` parameter to process only particular events. Check out an example for details.

**Example of joining Go panics**:
```yaml
pipelines:
  example_pipeline:
    ...
    actions:
    - type: join_template
      template: go_panic
      field: log
      match_fields:
        stream: stderr // apply only for events which was written to stderr to save CPU time
    ...
```

### Config params
**`field`** *`cfg.FieldSelector`* *`default=log`* *`required`* 

The event field which will be checked for joining with each other.

<br>

**`max_event_size`** *`int`* *`default=0`*
